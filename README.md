## What?
This is a bookshelf app (I called it Boodit), created to fulfill the [Dicoding Submission](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/315). As its name, this app is used to organize your book digitally with basic **features** like:
1. Add, update, and delete book,
2. Search book by its title.

## Tech Stack
There is no fancy tech stack here, I just use the old-fashioned way (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS).
